# Ethco AI Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan to transform the existing `MyAssistant` project into the envisioned `Ethco AI` autonomous agent, incorporating a VS Code-inspired layout and real-time tool usage feedback.

## 1. Codebase Analysis Summary

### Current State of `MyAssistant`

The `MyAssistant` project provides a foundational AI agent with a React frontend and a FastAPI Python backend. It features:

*   **Backend:**
    *   FastAPI application (`main.py`) with CORS, health check, session management, and WebSocket endpoints.
    *   `agent_core.py`: Manages agent task execution.
    *   `gemini_handler.py`: Integrates with Gemini API for plan generation.
    *   `filesystem_tools.py`: Provides sandboxed filesystem operations (CREATE_FILE, ADD_CONTENT, DELETE_FILE, CREATE_FOLDER, DELETE_FOLDER).
    *   `session_manager.py`: Handles session creation, retrieval, and history.
    *   `websocket_manager.py`: Manages real-time communication between frontend and backend.
    *   `prompt.md`: Defines the AI agent's constitution, core directives, available tools, and plan syntax.

*   **Frontend:**
    *   A React application (details to be further explored, but `README.md` indicates a responsive UI).
    *   Configured with Vite, allowing `allowedHosts` for `.manus.computer`.

### Key Strengths:

*   **Modular Architecture:** Clear separation between frontend and backend.
*   **AI Agent Core:** Existing logic for agent task execution and plan generation using Gemini.
*   **Filesystem Tools:** Basic file manipulation capabilities are already present.
*   **Real-time Communication:** WebSocket integration is in place for live updates.
*   **Session Management:** Foundation for persistent user sessions.

## 2. Ethco AI Vision vs. Current Implementation

### What is Implemented (or has a strong foundation):

*   **AI Agent Core:** The `agent_core.py` and `gemini_handler.py` provide the brain for the AI.
*   **Terminal Execution (Partial):** The `filesystem_tools.py` provides some interaction with the sandbox, which is a step towards terminal execution. However, direct arbitrary command execution is not explicitly implemented as a tool for the agent.
*   **File Management:** `filesystem_tools.py` covers basic CRUD operations for files and folders.
*   **Chat Window (Partial):** The existing React frontend likely has a chat interface, but its integration with the full Ethco AI vision (VS Code layout, real-time feedback) needs enhancement.
*   **Memory Management (Partial):** `session_manager.py` handles session history, which is a form of memory, but a more explicit persistent and context-aware memory for the LLM is needed.

### What is Lacked Completely:

*   **VS Code-Inspired Layout:** The current frontend does not feature the distinct File Tree, Code Editor, and Chat Window panes as described.
*   **Monaco Editor Integration:** The central code editor component is missing.
*   **Comprehensive Browser Integration:** While the agent can perform some web-related tasks, a full-fledged browser tool with navigation, content extraction (text, Markdown, HTML), element interaction (clicking, forms), and screenshot capabilities is not present.
*   **Real-time Visual Feedback:** The visual indicators for agent actions (e.g., writing to file, terminal command running, web browsing) are not implemented.
*   **Dual Frontend Switch:** The ability to switch between a simple window layout and the VS Code-inspired layout is not present.

### What needs Enhancement:

*   **Terminal Execution:** Expand the agent's capabilities to execute arbitrary shell commands within the project context, with output displayed in the chat.
*   **Memory Management:** Implement a more sophisticated memory system for the LLM to store and retrieve user preferences, project-specific knowledge, and adapt its persona.
*   **Professional and Appealing Frontend:** The existing frontend needs significant design and UI/UX improvements to match the professional and appealing aesthetic of the Ethco AI vision.

## 3. Detailed To-Do List

## 4. GitHub Interaction Rules

*   **Constant Updates:** The `TODO.md` file will be updated as tasks are completed or new insights emerge.
*   **Commit Frequency:** Each time a task is completed and the `TODO.md` is updated, a commit will be made to the repository.
*   **Commit Message:** Commit messages will clearly indicate the completed task (e.g., "FEAT: Implemented X feature", "DOCS: Updated TODO.md for Y").
*   **Push:** Changes will be pushed to the `main` branch after each commit.

**---

**Note:** This plan is dynamic and will be adjusted as development progresses and new requirements arise. The primary goal is to deliver a robust, intuitive, and powerful AI agent development environment.
